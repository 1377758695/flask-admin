Flask-Admin
===========

**Why Flask?** As a micro-framework, `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ lets you build web services with very little overhead.
It offers lots of flexibility for you, the designer, to implement your project in a way that makes sense.

But the freedom comes at a price: Flask doesn't have all
the builtin magic that you might expect if you are used to other web frameworks.
In stead, it relies on a rich ecosystem of plugins that lets you cherry-pick just the functionality that's of interest to you.

**Why Flask-Admin?** In a world of microservices and API's, Flask-Admin solves
a really boring problem: It lets you quickly build an admin suite on top
of your data so that you, or someone else can start managing your web service without
having to constantly scratch around in the database.
